# GESTURE-BASED-ROVER
Explore the next frontier with our innovative GESTURE-BASED-ROVER system, which allows you to control a rover using just your hand gestures. Powered by advanced OpenCV and CNN technologies, our system captures and classifies your hand gestures through a camera and then converts them into commands to control the movements of the rover. Our repository contains the project's source code, enabling you to take advantage of the latest advancements in technology. Check out the image of the rover in action
